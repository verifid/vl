# vl

**vl** is the ``verification layer`` of **verifid**, actually the core project that is responsible from verifying identity cards or passports. Basically it's a self deployed API which has 4 main endpoints. It runs on either ``Docker`` or ``Kubernetes`` as a container. All endpoints fit in just two controllers and all endpoints have detailly documented. **vl** relies on some other **verifid** and as well as other Open Source Python modules. **vl** uses **Nginx** as a load balancer and it's already configured in setup files.

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.
